        # What is Number Theory?

        Number theory is the study of integers. We can use many concepts from number
        theory in programming, since we're almost always dealing with integers.

        ---

        # Topics for today

        * Modular Arithmetic
        * Greatest Common Divisor / Least Common Multiple
        * Primality detection
        * Finding primes
        * Factorization

        ---

        # Modular Arithmetic

        Many problem statements in competitive programming dealing with large numbers
        end with "output the number modulo 1000000007 (`1e9 + 7`)

        Why this number?

        How can we use this to our advantage?

        ---

        # Divisability

        Here and in the rest of the lecture, assume all variables are integers.

        We say that "$a$ divides $b$" if there exists an integer $k$ such that $ak =
        b$.

        Equivalently, dividing $b$ by $a$ gives no remainder.

        That remainder is given by the modulus operator&mdash;`%` in most
        languages&mdash;so `b % a == 0` if and only if `a` divides `b`.

        ---

        # Properties of the Modulus operator

        Assume we have two positive integers `a` and `b`

        Possible values of `a % b` are in the set $\\{0, 1, ..., b-1\\}$.

        Useful properties: distributivity under addition, subtraction, and
        multiplication.
        * `(a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n`
        * `(a - b) % n = ((a % n) - (b % n) + n) % n`
        * `(a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n`
        * **NOT** over division. Counterexample: <br />
        `(12 / 2) % 4 = 6 % 4 = 2`, but <br />
        `((12 % 4) / (2 % 4)) % 4 = (0 / 2) % 4 = 0 % 4 = 0`.

        ---

        # Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

        Any positive integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization into a
        product of powers of primes.

        $72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$

        $5 = 5^1$

        ---

        # Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

        The greatest common divisor of a set of integers $\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\\}$ is
        the largest integer that divides every number in the set.

        Examples:
        * $\mathrm{GCD}(12, 24, 144) = 12$
        * $\mathrm{GCD}(56, 42, 126, 28) = 14$
        * $\mathrm{GCD}(3, 5, 7) = 1$

        ---

        # Least Common Multiple (LCM)

        The least common multiple of a set of integers $\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\\}$ is
        the smallest integer that is a multiple of every number in the set.

        Examples:
        * $\mathrm{LCM}(5, 6) = 30$
        * $\mathrm{LCM}(20, 15) = 60$
        * $\mathrm{LCM}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 120$

        ---

        # Euclid's Algorithm

        The GCD can be computed using Euclid's Algorithm:

        ```javascript
        function gcd(a, b) {
        if b == 0
            return a
        else
            return gcd(b, a % b)
        }
        ```

        Why does this work? Can a similar algorithm find the LCM?

        ---

        # Prime detection: Trial Division

        A prime is an integer whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself.

        Na√Øve `isPrime(x)` function: check all numbers between $2$ and $x - 1$ and
        check if they're divisors.

        Runtime? What if you ignore even numbers? Any way to further reduce the
        runtime of this algorithm?

        ---

        # Prime detection: Trial Division (cont'd)

        If a number $x$ has a divisor $d$ such that $d &gt; \sqrt{x}$, then $x / d
        &lt; \sqrt{x}$.

        If we know that $d \cdot y = x$, and we know $d$, we can find $y$.

        Thus, we need to only manually check up to $\sqrt{x}$.

        ---

        # Prime detection: Sieve of Eratosthenes

        This is a process of elimination to find primes. Take an upper bound $N$ on the
        largest prime you care about. Then an array of size $N + 1$ (because it
        includes 0) can hold primality for any number in range.

        To start with, assume everything except 0 and 1 is prime (since we don't know
        any better yet). What can we exclude?

        ---

        # Prime detection: Sieve of Eratosthenes (cont'd)

        Well, 2 is prime, but no other even number is&mdash;no multiple of 2. So loop
        up through the multiples of two (starting with 4) and knock them out (set
        their value in the array to `false`).

        Now, 3 (the next `true` value in the array) is certainly prime. Again, none of
        its multiples are, so loop up through the multiples of three (starting with 6)
        and knock them out two.

        Four has been knocked out, so skip over it. Five is our next `true` value, so
        it's prime, and we knock out its multiples, and so on.

        ---

        # Prime detection: Sieve of Eratosthenes (cont'd)

        Some optimizations:
        * Looping from 0 to $N$ is fine, but it's faster to do the 2-case on its own,
        then loop over odd numbers from 3 to $N$.
        * Every other multiple of an odd number is even, and thus has been knocked out
        in the 2-case. So we need only check every *other* multiple.

        ---

        # Example Sieve of Eratosthenes

        ```java
        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[N];
        Arrays.fill(isPrime, true);
        isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

        for (int p = 2; i &lt; N; p++) {
            if (!isPrime[p]) continue;
            for (int i = p * 2; i &lt; N; i += p) {
                isPrime[i] = false;
            }
        }
        ```
        ---

        # Example Sieve of Eratosthenes With Optimization
        ```java
        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[N];
        Arrays.fill(isPrime, true);
        isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false;

        for (int p = 2; p &lt; N; p += 2)
            isPrime[p] = false;
        for (int p = 3; p &lt; N; p += 2) {
            if (!isPrime[p]) continue;
            for (int i = p * p; i &lt; N; i += p * 2) {
                isPrime[i] = false;
            }
        }
        ```

        ---

        # Prime Factorization with the Sieve

        So, we can use the normal Sieve to find all prime numbers up to $N$. But we can do
        more with this concept, and it's awesome.

        Initialize each index's value to that index. Instead of setting values to false
        when we "knock something out", instead store the value that did the knocking-out.

        ---

        # Prime Factorization with the Sieve (cont'd)

        Now each slot in the array holds a prime number. In particular, it holds the
        largest prime number that divides that slot's index (unless the index is even, in
        which case it just holds $2$).

        Note that we still have `isPrime` from this: if the value in slot $x$ is $x$
        itself, then $x$ must be prime.

        Then with a very simple tiny loop, we can easily get all the prime factors!

        ---

        # Example Modified Sieve

        ```java
        int[] sieve = new int[N];
        sieve[0] = sieve[1] = 0; // not prime, but no better value.

        for (int p = 2; p &lt; N; p += 2)
            sieve[p] = 2;
        for (int p = 3; p &lt; N; p += 2)
            if (sieve[p] != p) continue;
            for (int i = p * p; i &lt; N; i += p * 2) {
                sieve[i] = p;

        List<Integer> getFactors(int n) {
            List<Integer> factors = new LinkedList<>();
            while (n > 1) {
                factors.add(sieve[n]);
                n /= sieve[n];
            }
            return factors;
        }
        ```

            # What is Number Theory?

            Number theory is the study of integers. We can use many concepts from number
            theory in programming, since we're almost always dealing with integers.

            ---

            # Topics for today

            * Modular Arithmetic
            * Greatest Common Divisor / Least Common Multiple
            * Primality detection
            * Finding primes
            * Factorization

            ---

            # Modular Arithmetic

            Many problem statements in competitive programming dealing with large numbers
            end with "output the number modulo 1000000007 (`1e9 + 7`)

            Why this number?

            How can we use this to our advantage?

            ---

            # Divisability

            Here and in the rest of the lecture, assume all variables are integers.

            We say that "$a$ divides $b$" if there exists an integer $k$ such that $ak =
            b$.

            Equivalently, dividing $b$ by $a$ gives no remainder.

            That remainder is given by the modulus operator&mdash;`%` in most
            languages&mdash;so `b % a == 0` if and only if `a` divides `b`.

            ---

            # Properties of the Modulus operator

            Assume we have two positive integers `a` and `b`

            Possible values of `a % b` are in the set $\\{0, 1, ..., b-1\\}$.

            Useful properties: distributivity under addition, subtraction, and
            multiplication.
            * `(a + b) % n = ((a % n) + (b % n)) % n`
            * `(a - b) % n = ((a % n) - (b % n) + n) % n`
            * `(a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n`
            * **NOT** over division. Counterexample: <br />
              `(12 / 2) % 4 = 6 % 4 = 2`, but <br />
              `((12 % 4) / (2 % 4)) % 4 = (0 / 2) % 4 = 0 % 4 = 0`.

            ---

            # Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

            Any positive integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization into a
            product of powers of primes.

            $72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2$

            $5 = 5^1$

            ---

            # Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

            The greatest common divisor of a set of integers $\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\\}$ is
            the largest integer that divides every number in the set.

            Examples:
            * $\mathrm{GCD}(12, 24, 144) = 12$
            * $\mathrm{GCD}(56, 42, 126, 28) = 14$
            * $\mathrm{GCD}(3, 5, 7) = 1$

            ---

            # Least Common Multiple (LCM)

            The least common multiple of a set of integers $\\{a_1, a_2, ..., a_k\\}$ is
            the smallest integer that is a multiple of every number in the set.

            Examples:
            * $\mathrm{LCM}(5, 6) = 30$
            * $\mathrm{LCM}(20, 15) = 60$
            * $\mathrm{LCM}(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) = 120$

            ---

            # Euclid's Algorithm

            The GCD can be computed using Euclid's Algorithm:

            ```javascript
            function gcd(a, b) {
                if b == 0
                    return a
                else
                    return gcd(b, a % b)
            }
            ```

            Why does this work? Can a similar algorithm find the LCM?

            ---

            # Prime detection: trial division

            A prime is an integer whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself.

            Na√Øve `isPrime(x)` function: check all numbers between $2$ and $x - 1$ and
            check if they're divisors.

            Runtime? What if you ignore even numbers? Any way to further reduce the
            runtime of this algorithm?

            ---

            # Trial Division

            If a number $x$ has a divisor $d$ above $\sqrt{x}$, then $x / d &lt; \sqrt{x}$.
